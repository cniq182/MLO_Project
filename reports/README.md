# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

`![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)`

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

or

```bash
uv add typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the

## Group information

### Question 1
> **Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk>**
>
> Group 37

### Question 2
> **Enter the study number for each member in the group**
>
> Answer:

    s243927, s250273, s250202,s254631,s250829

### Question 3
> **Did you end up using any open-source frameworks/packages not covered in the course during your project? If so**
> **which did you use and how did they help you complete the project?**

Yes, we used several open-source tools that were not directly covered in the course.
We mainly used the Hugging Face Transformers library, which made it easy to load and fine-tune pretrained transformer models such as T5. This allowed us to focus on adapting existing models to the translation task instead of implementing them from scratch.
We also used the Hugging Face Datasets package to load and preprocess the OpenSubtitles dataset from OPUS. It simplified handling large amounts of parallel text data.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**

We managed dependencies using Python’s pyproject.toml, together with a lock file (uv.lock). All required packages and their versions are defined in these files, which ensures that everyone in the group uses the same dependencies.

To allow reproducibility, we used uv as the package and environment manager. The lock file guarantees that the exact same versions of all dependencies are installed on different machines.

For a new team member to get an exact copy of the development environment, the process would be:
1. Clone the project repository.
2. Install uv.
3. Navigate to the project root directory.
4. Run: (uv sync) to install all dependencies using the lock file.
5. Run the project using: (uv run main.py).

Following these steps ensures that a new team member can reproduce the same environment and run the code without additional configuration.

### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**

We initialized our project using the course-provided cookiecutter template, which gave us a standardized and organized project structure.

When setting up the project, we filled out the cookiecutter prompts such as the project name, package name, and basic metadata. Most default settings provided by the template were kept, as they already matched the needs of our project.

The main project code follows the structure defined by the template. The core Python package is located under src/en_es_translation, which contains separate modules for data handling, model definition, training, evaluation, prediction, and visualization. This separation helped keep responsibilities clear and made the code easier to maintain. The template’s suggested folders for data, models, configs, notebooks, reports, and tests were also used, which supported a clean workflow from data preprocessing to evaluation and reporting.

We made a small deviation from the template by adding a  main.py file. This file serves as a simple entry point to run the project using uv run main.py, while the main logic remains inside the structured package under src/. Apart from this, the overall structure follows the original cookiecutter template, and no major components were removed.

### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>

We did not use automatic tools for code formatting or linting, such as Black or Flake8. Instead, we tried to keep the code readable by following common Python style conventions and by writing clear and consistent code within the group.

We also did not use explicit typing or type-checking tools. Most functions were written without type hints, as the main focus of the project was on implementing and testing the machine translation pipeline rather than enforcing strict type rules.

For documentation, we used README files and docstrings. The README files explain the overall project structure and how to run the code, while docstrings are used in important parts of the code, such as the data loading and model logic, to describe what the functions and classes do.

In larger projects, code quality and documentation are important because many people may work on the same code over time. Clear code and good documentation make it easier for others to understand, use, and change the code, and help reduce mistakes and confusion

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In total, we implemented 7 tests, covering both the data pipeline and the model set up. For the data part, the tests checked that the custom dataset behaves as expected and that the preprocessing step correctly creates the train, validation and test splits. Additionally, it was relevant to test that padding tokens in the labels were properly handled. We also test that preprocessing is automatically triggered when processed data is missing. For the model, the tests focus on the most critical functionality, which includes:
- validating hyperparameters during initialization
- ensuring the forward pass returns a list of translated strings
- verifying that the training step produces a valid loss
- confirming that the optimizer is correctly configured

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**
>
Our workflow made extensive use of branches, allowing team members to work on different features or experiments in parallel without directly affecting the main branch. Each contributor typically developed their changes on a separate branch and ensured that their work was stable before integrating it into the main codebase. This helped reduce conflicts and made it easier to manage and test incremental changes. Naturally, some conflicts arised and we had to communicate to solve them.

However, we did not rely heavily on formal pull requests. Since the team was in constant communication throughout the project, most merges were coordinated directly among team members. This allowed us to resolve potential conflicts quickly and ensured that everyone was aware of ongoing changes. 

We believe the combination of frequent branching and continuous communication enabled efficient collaboration while still maintaining control over the project’s evolution.

### Question 10

> **Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version**
> **control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.**

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

We configured our experiments using .yaml configuration files. We separated settings both for the data processing and training step. This allowed us to define key hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size or number of epochs, as well as dataset-related parameters without changing the code itself. The code also established default hyperparameters in case we did not want to use a config file. We also used Hydra to load and manage these configurations, which made it easy to run different experiments or modify specific parameters through command-line overrides.
For example, an experiment for the data processing can be run as:

--> uv run en_es_translation/src/en_es_translation/data.py data=data_2

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

To ensure reproducibility, we relied on configuration files we mentioned earlier to capture all relevant information for each experiment. Both data preprocessing parameters and training hyperparameters were stored in .yaml files that were version controlled, ensuring that experiment settings were explicit. Hydra handles the configuration composition at runtime, which helps prevent inconsistencies between runs.

We also used logging throughout the data processing and training steps to record important execution details. When enabled, Weights & Biases was used to log configurations, metrics and checkpoints. This made tracking and comparing experiments easier, as well as providing a clearer visualization of different hyperparameter combinations. Weights & Biases will be discussed in the following question. To reproduce a specific experiment, one only needs to rerun the code using the same configuration files or command-line overrides.

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**
> **important.**
